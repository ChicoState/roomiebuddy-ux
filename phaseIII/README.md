## Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing


### Introduction

RoomieBuddy is an app designed to help people manage shared responsibilities while living with roommates. In this phase, our focus was to evaluate the usability of our working prototype in figma to ensure that users could complete key tasks related to chore assignment, messaging, and prioritization. We conducted a usability test protocol with our UX classmates of 6 participants, who resemble our target audience to uncover areas of confusion and affirm the strengths of our design.

### Methods

We used a formative usability testing approach, with participants interacting directly with the prototype to simulate common roommate related scenarios. The moderator(Yeng and Sumomo) ask participants to solve through each task using a think aloud protocol, encouraging them to verbalize their thoughts.

#### Study Setup:
- **Participants**: 6 individuals ages 18+, living with 1–4 roommates, recruited from our UX class.
- **Design**: Within-subject design each participant completed all tasks.
- **Protocol Style**: Moderated think aloud usability test with structured tasks and post task difficulty ratings.

#### Tasks

**Task A: Join or Create a Team**  
**Scenario**: "Great, you're logged in. Can you find a team or create a new team for yourself?"  
- **Observe**: How fast they sign up and create or join a team?  
- **Evaluate**: Was the process smooth?

---

**Task B: Assign a Chore**  
**Scenario**: "Imagine it’s your turn to organize trash day. Assign the chore 'Take out trash' to your roommate Alex for Friday."  
- **Observe**: Can they find the right screen?  
- **Evaluate**:
  - Do they complete the task without hesitation or assistance?
  - Rate the difficulty from 1 (easy) to 5 (difficult).

---

**Task C: Mark a Task as Completed**  
**Scenario**: "You just finished doing the dishes. Mark that task as done in the app."  
- **Observe**: How quickly can they complete this?
- **Note**: Number of clicks, hesitation, or confusion.

---

**Task D: Check Task Priority**  
**Scenario**: "You want to see which tasks are the most urgent for this week."  
- **Observe**:
  - How do they interpret urgency?
  - Do they understand the labeling or icons used?
  - Can they easily see the level of urgency?

---

**Task E: Message a Roommate**  
**Scenario**: "You need to remind your roommate about an overdue task. Send them a message."  
- **Observe**:
  - Do they go to the task first or the messaging section?
  - Note mismatches in mental models.

---

**Task F: Suggest a New Feature**  
**Scenario**: "Imagine you’ve used RoomieBuddy for one month. What’s one feature you wish it had?"  
- **Prompt**: What would make this app more useful or fun?

---

Each task was selected to test a key usability component:
- **Task A**: Onboarding and navigation (effectiveness).
- **Task B**: Interaction design and labeling (efficiency, clarity).
- **Task C**: Task completion flow (learnability).
- **Task D**: Visual hierarchy and urgency cues (recognition).
- **Task E**: Mental model alignment (consistency, navigation).
- **Task F**: Open ended UX feedback (desirability and future development insights).

Quantitative and qualitative data were recorded in a spreadsheet:

### Findings

#### Quantitative Trends:
- **Task Completion**: All participants completed Task A, C, D, and E successfully.
- **Task B (Assign a Chore)**: Only 2 out of 6 participants completed this task without confusion.
- **Average Difficulty Rating**: 2.17 / 5 lower is better.
- **Time Taken**: Ranged from 15–22 minutes per session.

#### Qualitative Insights:
- Users found **Task B (Assign a Chore)** confusing—many struggled to identify the "+" icon’s purpose. Suggestions included replacing the "+" with a "Request" label or reworking the UI to make task assignment clearer.
- Some participants thought tasks disappeared when marked complete, leading to uncertainty.
- All participants praised the concept and said they would use the app if it was refined.
- Positive feedback emphasized the app's overall usability and intuitive icons, aside from the assignment issue.

---

### Conclusions

#### Recommended Changes:
- **Redesign the task assignment interaction**: Replace or clarify the "+" button for chore requests.
- **Improve task completion feedback**: Add a confirmation message or animation to assure users a task was successfully completed, not deleted.
- **Consider UI labeling**: Add descriptive text where possible to support user mental models.

#### Strengths to Keep:
- The **icons and layout** were praised by multiple users.
- **Messaging and urgency marking** were understood and completed smoothly by all users.
- Participants appreciated the overall look and flow of the app.

### Caveats

- **Limited Sample Size**: Only 6 users participated, all from a similar demographic,students in a UX course, which may not represent all roommate situations.
- **Prototype Fidelity**: As the prototype was not fully interactive and only prototype in figma, some tasks may not reflect real world use entirely.
- **Think-Aloud Limitations**: While helpful, some users struggled to express themselves verbally.
- **Not the Real App version**: We only observed first use impressions on the protoype, long term usability remains untested on the real app.
