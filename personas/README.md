# Scenarios

!!!Scenario!!!
Situation: Alex arrives home from work, feeling tired and ready to relax. His roommates are in
the living room, playing loud music and chatting. The noise is overwhelming, and Alex can’t
unwind. He tries to put in his earbuds, but the noise still seeps through.  
Goal: Alex wants to find a way to either have a peaceful space without having to confront his
roommates or to handle the situation aggressively if he needs to.  
<br>
Solution:
● Roomie Buddy app features:  
1. Earbuds Reminder: The app sends Alex a gentle reminder to grab his earbuds
before he leaves for work, so he’s always prepared when he returns home.  
2. Noise Monitoring: It tracks the noise levels in the apartment and sends a
notification when it exceeds a certain threshold, encouraging Alex to either find a
quiet space or gently nudge his roommates.  
3. Communication Templates: If Alex feels he needs to talk to his roommates, the
app offers pre-written, polite message templates that help him express his
feelings without sounding rude.  
4. Quiet Hours Feature: The app includes a shared “quiet hours” schedule where
everyone in the household can agree on certain times of day for quieter activities.
