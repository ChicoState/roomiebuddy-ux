# Wireframes

This section includes high-level wireframes for the RoomieBuddy mobile app prototype. These frames represent the main user flows and were designed to support key tasks identified through usability testing and user research.

Each wireframe is explained below in the context of a common user scenario to show how RoomieBuddy enables smooth, intuitive roommate coordination.

## Scenario Walkthrough: Assigning and Managing a Chore

1. **Sign In Page** – User logs into RoomieBuddy.
2. **Home Page** – From the dashboard, the user reviews tasks and chooses to add a new one.
3. **Task Add Page** – The user enters task details ("Take out trash"), assigns it to Alex, and sets the due date for Friday.
4. **Calendar Page** – The user confirms the task is now visible on the shared weekly view.
5. **Settings Page** – (Optional) User adjusts notification preferences to get a reminder the day before.

## Design Insights & Iterations

User feedback during usability testing led to refinements in button labeling and icon clarity—particularly on the Calendar and Task Add pages. Users expressed confusion around some priority indicators, which has been addressed with simplified visual cues. These findings reinforced the need for an intuitive visual language across all wireframes.

If any future iterations modify personas or scenarios, those updates will be reflected in the documentation accordingly.
