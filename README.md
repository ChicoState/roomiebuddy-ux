# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

The first phase of the project focused on understanding the target users, analyzing existing competitive products in the market, and creating initial design proposals. The project aims to address the common challenge of household management, especially for students and people living with roommates and families. Through this phase, we conducted an in-depth study of various tools and platforms for household task management, including Tody, ChoreBuster, OurGroceries, and Cozi. Each tool offers a specific solution but also has some limitations. For example, Tody excels in task visualization and flexibility but lacks family management features. Meanwhile, ChoreBuster specializes in scheduling but lacks general household management features. OurGroceries specializes in shopping list management but does not have household scheduling features. In this phase, we focused on identifying gaps in these existing solutions and understanding the most important needs of users. User research methods included surveys and competitive analysis to gather insights into users' preferences, pain points, and desired features. The survey results revealed that users struggle with task sharing, lack of communication, and inefficient tools. Therefore, our next step will be to use these insights to further refine our initial design proposal, integrating the features our users most want, and exploring how we can address these challenges.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

This usability study evaluated the RoomieBuddy prototype, a mobile app designed to streamline task sharing, communication, and scheduling among roommates. The goal of the study was to assess the appâ€™s effectiveness, efficiency, and alignment with user expectations through direct user interaction and structured task scenarios.

Participants were recruited based on relevant roommate experience and comfort with mobile productivity tools. Using a design where participants were guided through a series of core tasks, such as assigning chores, completing tasks, checking request status, messaging a roommate, and suggesting new features. A think-aloud protocol and post debriefing were used to gather both behavioral and attitudinal data.

Key findings indicate that users found the app intuitive and visually clear for chore assignment and completion. However, mental model mismatches emerged around navigation for messaging and interpreting task priority icons. Users also expressed a strong desire for more integrated communication features and gamification incentives to enhance engagement.

The results will inform the next iteration of RoomieBuddy, with recommended improvements focused on icon clarity, in-task commenting, and optional chore-tracking. Overall, participants responded positively and expressed interest in using RoomieBuddy to reduce conflict and improve transparency in shared living spaces.
