# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction
This project is aimed at a household management application for people living together, such as students or roommates. In this phase, we deeply understood the needs of users and analyzed competing products to formulate the first design proposal. The app market has products that meet different needs, such as Tody, ChoreBuster, OurGroceries, and Cozi, each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Tody specializes in cleaning tasks, but lacks household management and calendar functions. ChoreBuster specializes in household schedules, and OurGroceries specializes in shopping list management, but both lack other functions. The improvement point of the project is that there is no way for people living together to share household chores and daily tasks fairly. In this phase, we identified the strengths and weaknesses of the existing app, clarified the functions that are important to users, and considered the improvements to be made in the next design phase.

## Methods
### Questionnaires
**Objective**: To collect quantitative and qualitative data from a wide range of users to identify common problems and needs regarding household management.  
**Target**: Students living together, roommates, family members, etc.  
**Survey format**: Online survey (using Google Forms)  
**Questions**: How household chores are shared, how they are currently managed, what features they would like to see in a household management tool, areas for improvement, etc.
**Distribution**: Widely distributed via social media, student groups, online forums, etc.  
**Time required**: Respondents can complete the survey in about 10-15 minutes  
**Reproduction**: We ensured that other researchers could create surveys with the same questions and format and distribute them in the same way.  

## Findings
### Survey Results - Questionnaire Analysis

1. **Type of communal living**
- Most participants answered that they live with roommates (50%) or with their family (33.3%). No one lives alone, and the survey was aimed at people who live together, such as in student dormitories or apartments with roommates.

2. **How ​​housework is shared**
- Most participants (83.3%) answered that the division of household chores is **not decided** and that they do it as needed. This suggests that household chores are shared unevenly, and a lack of task management and communication may be an issue.
- Some people (33.3%) answered that they **regularly assign** chores, but it can be seen that there is often no specific division of labor.

3. **Housework management tools currently in use**
- Many participants (83.3%) answered that they **do not use** tools for household chore management, and instead rely on **verbal communication within the family**. This suggests that household management may not be done properly at present, and that efficient tools are needed.

- No one uses apps or lists, which suggests that the current tools do not meet the needs of users.

4. **Satisfaction with the current household management tool**
- Satisfaction levels are mixed, with 50% of participants indicating moderate satisfaction with **3 points**, 16.7% giving it a high rating of **4 points** or **5 points**, and one person indicating high dissatisfaction with **1 point**.
- There is room for improvement in the current household management tool, and it is clear that many users are not fully satisfied.

5. **Main features desired in a household management tool**
- The most desired feature is **task reminder and notification function** (100%), followed by **communication function with family and roommates** (83.3%).

- **Visual confirmation of task progress** (66.7%), **Prioritization of household chores** (66.7%), and **Budget management function** (50%) are also desired.

- It can be seen that users want a tool that allows them to manage the progress and priorities of household chores, and to remind them to do tasks without forgetting.

6. **Inconveniences of current household chore management tools**

- The first is that it is inconvenient that **notification contents** are unclear and you cannot see the contents unless you open the app. If notifications were more concise and clear, time would not be wasted.

- The second is that using a household chore management tool itself is **troublesome** and they would like to be able to do it at their own pace.

- These dissatisfaction shows that the current tool is difficult to use and troublesome, and a simpler and more flexible tool is desired.

7. **Features to be added to household chore management tools**

- **Functionality to set deadlines and completion deadlines for tasks** is desired, which is thought to make it easier to organize tasks and proceed in a planned manner. - This also indicates that there is a demand for tools with time management capabilities.

8. **Challenges with Housework**
- Several participants stated that they felt that household chores were **not shared equally** or that they were **unmotivated**. They also stated that household chores **pile up** and it is difficult to get them done all at once later.
- This suggests that there is a lack of motivation or effective sharing methods to perform household chores consistently, which is something that needs to be improved.　

## Conclusions
**Automatic task assignment and progress visualization**  
Users value being able to visually check the progress of their chores and how they are progressing, and want to prevent tasks from piling up. A graphical display of progress allows users to see "how much is done" and motivates them.  
Recommended: Provide a progress bar or checklist for each task so that users can immediately check the tasks they have performed. Incorporate a visual progress check function into the design.  

**Flexible and easy notification function**  
Users pointed out that the notification function was inconvenient, and there was a problem that it was not clear what to do when they received a notification. In addition, users also expressed an intention to work at their own pace.  
Recommended: Provide more specific and easy-to-understand notifications so that users can understand the necessary action without opening the app. By concisely indicating the task content in the notification and providing settings that can be customized as needed, stress can be reduced.  

**Prioritization and reminder function for chores**  
**100% of users want a reminder function, and the ability to set the priority of chores is important.**  
Recommendation: Add a feature that allows users to prioritize chores and provide a feature to send reminders for particularly important tasks. This feature will help users to complete chores efficiently and prevent chores from getting stuck.

**Flexible task management and division of labor**  
Users want to do chores at their own pace and would prefer to avoid forced task division or schedules.  
Recommendation: Allow users to set tasks flexibly, allowing them the "flexibility" to divide tasks as needed. Also provide an option to randomly or suggest tasks within the app to ensure that chores are assigned fairly.

**Easy communication between users**  
Users would like a feature that allows them to easily communicate with family and roommates about the progress and priorities of chores.  
Recommendation: Add a feature that allows users to easily exchange messages within the app (e.g., comment function or chat function) to facilitate smooth communication about tasks. This will reduce uncertainties and misunderstandings about the progress of chores and allow for smoother cooperation.
How this impacts future work

 **User-centered design:**  
By incorporating these new design recommendations with a deep understanding of user needs, we can develop an app that is easy to use and efficient. It is especially important to reflect the specific elements that users want, such as task management and progress visualization, and flexible notification functionality.

**The need for prototyping and testing:** 
It is essential to create a prototype based on the new design recommendations and conduct usability testing. We will check the user reaction to the notification functionality and task management flexibility, and verify whether there is room for improvement.

**Feature additions and improvements:** 
Based on user feedback, we will be required to enhance the notification customization and task prioritization functions. Also, the focus of future work will be to add necessary features while keeping the app interface simple and intuitive.
