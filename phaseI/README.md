# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction
This project is aimed at a household management application for people living together, such as students or roommates. In this phase, we deeply understood the needs of users and analyzed competing products to formulate the first design proposal. The app market has products that meet different needs, such as Tody, ChoreBuster, OurGroceries, and Cozi, each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Tody specializes in cleaning tasks, but lacks household management and calendar functions. ChoreBuster specializes in household schedules, and OurGroceries specializes in shopping list management, but both lack other functions. The improvement point of the project is that there is no way for people living together to share household chores and daily tasks fairly. In this phase, we identified the strengths and weaknesses of the existing app, clarified the functions that are important to users, and considered the improvements to be made in the next design phase.

## Methods
### Questionnaires
Objective: To collect quantitative and qualitative data from a wide range of users to identify common problems and needs regarding household management.  
Target: Students living together, roommates, family members, etc.  
Survey format: Online survey (using Google Forms and SurveyMonkey)  
Questions: How household chores are shared, how they are currently managed, what features they would like to see in a household management tool, areas for improvement, etc.
Distribution: Widely distributed via social media, student groups, online forums, etc.  
Time required: Respondents can complete the survey in about 10-15 minutes  
Reproduction: We ensured that other researchers could create surveys with the same questions and format and distribute them in the same way.  

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
